\f0\fs24 \cf0 With this project I was able to test my HTML and CSS abilities. It was easier than I thought but I got\
Stuck in some parts of it. \
\
To be able to finish it I had to use Google multiple times to make the code work and also to find out how to \
use code correctly to make it work the way I needed to. \
\
After completing this project I can say that I feel pretty comfortable using HTML and CSS. That includes \
flexbox and all it\'92s tools. }
